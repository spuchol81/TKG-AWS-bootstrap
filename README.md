IAM service is global so overlaping with previous deployments, even in other regions, can occur | `bool`| true
| TKGMgmtName | the name of the management cluster to deploy | `string` | spu-tkg-mgmt
| CreateWorkloadCLuster | Whether I should create a first workload cluster |`bool`| false

| WorkerType | Workers instance type for your workload clusters. | `string` | m5.large
| WorkerCount | Workers instance count for your workload clusters. | `Number` | 1
| TMCEnrollCLusters | Whether I should enroll created clusters to TMC |`bool`| false
| TmcApiToken | the name of the secret inside secret manager containing your TMC API TOKEN stored in the [Plaintext format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html)| `string` |Â TMC_API_TOKEN

## Deployment steps

First authenticate to aws console.   
Then click on Launch stack button. 
You'll be redirected to a cloudformation Form to select your infra details. 
Choose the region you want to operate in prior to fill the form. The only prerequisite is to have a valid EC2 keypair and a working VPC/subnet with internet access in this region. Default VPC is ok to be used.
The project will automatically:  
1. Deploy a dedicated jumpbox
2. Download tanzu binaries from my staging bucket
3. Download Open source tools for configuration
4. Deploy a new VPC with a Tanzu management Cluster and a Tanzu workload cluster inside it.   
5. Enroll deployed clusters to Tanzu Mission Control
6. Grab configuration of additional services with fluxCD
